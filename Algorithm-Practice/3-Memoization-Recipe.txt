//======= My Memoization Recipe: ==========

// stick to two high-level steps:
// 1. make it work. have a solution that is recursive. it's ok if it's slow
//    -visualize the problem as a tree.
//    -look for patterns. look for ways to shrink the problem.
//    -implement the tree using recursion. find the base case(s).
//    -test the brute force solution for correctness.

// 2. make it efficient.
//    -add a memo object 
//       -needs to have keys that represent arguments to the function
//       -values of the object need to represent the return values
//       -make sure the memo is shared among all the recursive calls 
//    -add a new base case to return memo values that captures the memo
//    -store return values expression into the memo before finally returning the memo object
