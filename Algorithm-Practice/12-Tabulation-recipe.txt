Tabulation Recipe:

You should have the most efficient version of the solution in one swoop (not like memoization)

1. Visualize the problem as a table 
 -size the table based on the inputs (be aware of an off-by-one scenario)
2. Initialize the table with default values 
 -choose compatible types (match return type with table value type. ie number to number)
3. Seed the trivial answer into the table
 -capture the scenario where I have a trivially small instance of the input with a known answer
4. Iterate through the table (hard part)
 -create logic that fills further positions of the table based on the current position
 -to do this, focus on what options I have at any point in the problem (go right, down, etc)
